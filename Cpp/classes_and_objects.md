# OOP Class Implementation Tasks

## 1. Rational Class

### Questions

- Write a complete definition of the class `Rational` with its methods defined outside.

- Write a program to implement this class. The program should:
  - a. Define `Rational` object called `x`.
  - b. Assign 22/7 to `x`.
  - c. Print the object's value as a rational number (e.g., 22/7).
  - d. Print the same rational number as a real number.
  - e. Invert `x`, such that `x` is 1/x.
  - f. Repeat the process c and d.
  - g. Check if you can print `num` and `den` of `x` from main. Discuss the reason behind your observation.
  - h. If you were not able to access `num` and `den` of `x` from outside, what should you do so that you can access them from anywhere?

## 2. Point Class

- Create a class `Point` that represents a three-dimensional coordinate system.
- Each object of `Point` should have coordinates `(x, y, z)` and methods to assign coordinates to the point objects.
- Add a method to calculate the distance from origin and to print the point in the form of `(x, y, z)`.

## 3. Person Class

- Design a class called `Person` that contains appropriate members for storing name, age, gender, and telephone number.
- Write member functions that can read and display these data.

## 4. Circle Class

- Write a program to represent a Circle. Include member functions to perform the following tasks:
  - a. Calculate area of the circle.
  - b. Calculate perimeter of the circle.
