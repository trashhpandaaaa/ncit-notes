1. Write a complete definition of the class Rational with it's method defined outside.
2. Write a program to implement this class. The promgram should
        a. Define Rational object called x.
        b. Assign 22/7 to x.
        c. Print the object's value as a rational number (eg 22/7)
        d. Print the same rational number as a real number
        e. Invert x, such that x is 1/x
        f. Repeat the process c and d.
        g. Check if you can print num and den of x from main. Discuss the reason behind your observation
        h. If you where not able to access num and den of x from outside. what should you do so that you can access them from anywhere?
3. Create a class Point that represents a three dimensional coordinate system. Each object of Point should have coordinates, (x,y,z) and methods to assign coordinates to the point objects. Add a method to calculate the distance from origin and to print the pointin the form of (x,y,z)
4. Design a class called Person that contains appropriate members for storing name, age, gender and telephone number. Write member functions that can read and display these data. 
5. Write a program to represent a Circle. Include member functions to perform the following task: 
        a. Calculate area of the circle.
